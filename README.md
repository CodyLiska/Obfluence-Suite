# Obfluence

**Obfluence** is a modular, opinionated Obsidian framework designed to bring the structure and scalability of Confluence to your personal knowledge base.

This repository contains three main Obsidian vault templates:

- `Obfluence Core`: foundational layouts, templates, and best practices
- `Obfluence HomeLab`: organize, document, and automate your self-hosted infrastructure
- `Obfluence Personal`: track your goals, habits, health, finances, and daily life

Each vault is fully modular and extensible — plug them into your own workflows or use them as-is to level up your digital organization.
