# Obfluence HomeLab

Welcome to your **Obfluence HomeLab** — a structured, developer-centric vault designed to document, manage, and scale all aspects of your self-hosted infrastructure, software experimentation, learning, and systems automation.

This vault uses a Confluence-inspired structure combined with the power of Obsidian plugins like Templater, Dataview, and QuickAdd to offer both structure and flexibility.

- `Upgrade_Failures/`: Patch failures, upgrade logs.

### `12_Changelogs/`

Versioned updates to your lab — hardware changes, deployments, upgrades.

### `99_Credentials/`

**Sensitive metadata only** — passwords and keys should be stored in a secure password manager (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden).

- `API Keys/`
- `Service Accounts/`

## Suggested Plugins

- **Templater** – Auto-generating structured notes
- **Dataview** – Table/list summaries for `_index.md` dashboards
- **QuickAdd** – Capture new device/service/project notes with prompts
- **Obsidian Encrypt** – For encrypting local credential notes
- **Advanced Tables** – For editing inventory/logs
- **Canvas** – Architecture and rack layout boards
- **Periodic Notes + Calendar** – For operational logs and journaled change tracking

---

## Usage Tips

- Use `_index.md` in each folder to dynamically show child notes using `Dataview`.
- Templates ensure every note has standard fields like title, tags, description, and date.
- Add task lists for maintenance and link to system dashboards.
- Use QuickAdd to reduce friction when adding new entries.

Maintain your lab documentation as carefully as your systems — you’ll thank yourself when scaling, debugging, or recovering!
